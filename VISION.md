# Vision

This project has a dual identity:

1.  **A Production-Ready Library for Time-Aware Computing:** The primary focus of this project is to provide a battle-tested, production-grade library for Time-Aware Computing. This module is intended for use in real-world systems where time-budgeted computation is critical.

2.  **A Research Toolkit for Advanced Computational Principles:** The project also serves as a research toolkit for exploring seven advanced computational principles. These modules are intended for academic and learning purposes, and are not recommended for production deployment.

## Target Audience

*   **Production Engineers:** For the Time-Aware Computing library.
*   **CS Researchers:** For the research toolkit.
*   **Graduate Students:** For both the production library and the research toolkit.
*   **Engineers:** For learning about advanced computational principles.

## Intended Use

*   **Time-Aware Computing Library:** Production deployment in real-time systems, performance-critical applications, and resource-constrained environments.
*   **Research Toolkit:** Academic research, education, and experimentation.
