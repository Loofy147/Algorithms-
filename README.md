# Advanced Computational Principles

This project provides production-ready implementations of seven fundamental computational principles that are often overlooked in traditional computer science education. These principles are essential for building robust, efficient, and secure real-world systems.

For detailed information on the theory, research, and implementation of each principle, please see the documentation in the `docs/` directory.

## Principles Implemented

- **[Time-Aware Computing](./docs/time_aware_computing.md)**: Algorithms that treat time as a primary constraint.
- **[Resource-Aware Computing](./docs/resource_aware_computing.md)**: Multi-objective optimization for resources like energy, memory, and bandwidth.
- **[Adversarial-First Design](./docs/adversarial_first_design.md)**: A security-focused approach to software development.
- **[Algebraic Composability](./docs/algebraic_composability.md)**: Creating components that can be combined in provably correct ways.
- **[Uncertainty Quantification](./docs/uncertainty_quantification.md)**: Quantitatively estimating the doubt in a model's prediction.
- **[Self-Modifying Algorithms](./docs/self_modifying_algorithms.md)**: Algorithms that can change their own behavior in response to their environment.
- **[Causal Reasoning](./docs/causal_reasoning.md)**: Identifying and understanding cause-and-effect relationships.
