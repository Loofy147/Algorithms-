# Twin-AI Algorithms

## Overview
This document describes the core algorithms used in the Twin-AI system, leveraging advanced computational principles.

## Time-Aware Computing
- **Anytime Algorithms**: Quicksort, Gzip, Image Resize, and SHA256. These algorithms provide a result at any point during their execution, with quality improving over time.
- **WCET Analysis**: Worst-Case Execution Time analysis for real-time constraints.

## Resource-Aware Computing
- **ResourceAwareScheduler**: A multi-objective scheduler that optimizes task execution based on CPU, memory, energy, and carbon intensity budgets.
- **DVFS Controller**: Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling based on system load and battery level.

## Uncertainty Quantification
- **ProbabilisticCounter**: Provides statistically sound confidence intervals (Wilson score) for pattern detection.
- **PatternDetector**: Identifies user behavioral patterns with quantifiable confidence.

## Resilience
- **CircuitBreaker**: Prevents system cascade failure by failing fast when downstream services are unhealthy.
