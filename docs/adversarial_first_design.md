# Adversarial-First Design

## Theoretical Background

Adversarial-First Design is a security-focused software development methodology that treats potential attacks and malicious actors as primary design constraints. Instead of adding security as an afterthought, this approach integrates threat modeling and defensive thinking into every stage of the development lifecycle.

The core principles of Adversarial-First Design include:

- **Assume a Hostile Environment**: Never trust external input. Always validate, sanitize, and encode data.
- **Secure Defaults**: The default configuration of a system should be the most secure configuration.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: A component should only have the permissions it absolutely needs to do its job.
- **Defense in Depth**: Employ multiple layers of security controls, so that if one fails, another can still protect the system.
- **Minimize Attack Surface**: Reduce the amount of code that is exposed to potential attackers.

## Implementation Details

This project implements a `SecureHashMap` to demonstrate Adversarial-First Design. This is a hash map that is designed to be resistant to two common attacks:

- **Collision Attacks**: An attacker can try to find multiple keys that hash to the same value, causing a denial of service. The `SecureHashMap` defends against this by using a randomized hash function and by detecting and mitigating collision attacks at runtime.

- **Timing Attacks**: An attacker can try to infer information about the keys in a hash map by measuring the time it takes to perform operations. The `SecureHashMap` defends against this by using constant-time operations, which always take the same amount of time to execute, regardless of the input.
