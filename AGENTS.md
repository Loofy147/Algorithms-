# Agents Manifest

This document provides a manifest of the tools, environment, and orchestration steps used to maintain this repository. It is intended to be used by AI agents to ensure consistent and reliable maintenance.

## Toolchain

- **Node.js**: v18.x (or higher)
- **pnpm**: v8.x (or higher)
- **ESLint**: v9.x
- **Jest**: v30.x
- **standard-version**: v9.x
- **JSDoc**: v4.x
- **Vite**: v7.x

## Orchestration Steps

The following steps should be followed for any maintenance or release task:

1.  **Comprehensive Diagnostics**:
    -   Run `pnpm install` at the root to ensure all workspace dependencies are up-to-date.
    -   Run `npx eslint .` to identify any linting issues.
    -   Run `npm audit` to check for security vulnerabilities.
    -   Run `npm test` to ensure the test suite is passing.

2.  **Automated Remediation**:
    -   Address any linting issues or security vulnerabilities identified in the previous step.
    -   Ensure the test suite is still passing after any changes.

3.  **CI/CD & Release Automation**:
    -   The CI/CD pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/node.js.yml` and is run automatically on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.
    -   The release process is automated using the `release.yml` workflow. This workflow should be triggered manually to create a new release.

4.  **Documentation & Transparency**:
    -   The `CHANGELOG.md` is automatically generated by the release workflow.
    -   The `README.md` should be updated to reflect any changes to the project's features or usage.
    -   This `AGENTS.md` file should be updated to reflect any changes to the toolchain or orchestration steps.
